\title{Read FASTA files efficiently}
\usage{
fast_fasta(path, noisy = F)

\item{path}{Path to FASTA file}

\item{noisy}{Logical; if TRUE, prints the number of sequences loaded. Default
is FALSE.}
}
\value{
Named character vector where names are sequence identifiers and values
are the sequences (multi-line sequences are concatenated into single strings)

\description{
Reads FASTA format files, handling both single-line and multi-line sequences.
