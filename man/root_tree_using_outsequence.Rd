  remove_outsequence = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{Phylogenetic tree to root}

\item{sequences}{Named vector of sequences for tree tips}

\item{outsequence}{Outgroup sequence (will be truncated to match sequence length)}

\item{cmaple_path}{Path to CMAPLE executable}

\item{remove_outsequence}{Remove outgroup from final tree (default TRUE)}

\description{
Adds an outgroup sequence to the tree using CMAPLE, roots via that outgroup,
and optionally removes the outgroup afterward.
