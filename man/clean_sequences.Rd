\title{Remove non-standard characters from sequences}
\usage{
clean_sequences(sequences, type, alphabet = NULL, replacement_character = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{sequences}{A character vector of sequences (names are preserved if present)}

\item{type}{Either "aa" (amino acid) or "nt" (nucleotide)}

\item{alphabet}{(optional) Character vector defining valid characters. Defaults:
\itemize{
\item For type "aa": The 20 standard amino acids (ARNDCQEGHILKMFPSTWYV) plus "-"
\item For type "nt": A, T, C, G, and "-"
}}

\item{replacement_character}{(optional) Character to replace non-standard characters with.
Defaults to "X" for amino acids and "N" for nucleotides. Use "-" to replace with gaps.}
}
\value{
A character vector of cleaned sequences with names preserved
}
\description{
Replaces any characters not in the specified alphabet with a replacement character.
All sequences are converted to uppercase before processing.
}
\examples{
# Clean nucleotide sequences
clean_sequences(c("ATCGXYZ", "GGGNNN"), type = "nt")  # X,Y,Z become N

# Clean amino acid sequences
clean_sequences(c("ACDEF123"), type = "aa")  # 1,2,3 become X

# Use custom replacement
clean_sequences("ATC-G", type = "nt", replacement_character = "-")

}
