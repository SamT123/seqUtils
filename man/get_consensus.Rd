\title{Calculate consensus sequence from multiple sequences}
\usage{
get_consensus(sequences, excluded_characters = c(), min_freq = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{sequences}{Character vector of aligned sequences}

\item{excluded_characters}{Characters to ignore when calculating frequencies
(e.g., "-", "X", "N")}

\item{min_freq}{Minimum frequency (0-1) required for a character to be used.
Positions below this threshold become "?" (default: 0.5)}
}
\value{
Single consensus sequence as a character string
}
\description{
Returns the most frequent character at each position. Sequences are converted to
uppercase before processing. Positions without a character meeting the frequency
threshold are marked with "?".
}
\examples{
# Basic consensus
seqs <- c("ACGT", "ACGT", "ACAT")
get_consensus(seqs)  # Returns "ACGT" (G appears in 2/3 sequences)

# With frequency threshold
seqs <- c("ACGT", "ACAT", "ATTT")
get_consensus(seqs, min_freq = 0.7)  # Returns "A??T"

# Exclude gaps from calculation
seqs <- c("AC-T", "ACGT", "AC-T")
get_consensus(seqs, excluded_characters = "-")

}
