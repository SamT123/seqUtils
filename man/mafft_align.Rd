\title{Align sequences to a reference using MAFFT}
\usage{
mafft_align(unaligned_sequences, reference_sequence)
}
\arguments{
\item{unaligned_sequences}{Character vector of unaligned sequences (can include NAs)}

\item{reference_sequence}{Single reference sequence to align to}
}
\value{
Character vector of aligned sequences (same length as reference), with
names preserved. NA sequences remain NA.
}
\description{
Aligns sequences to a reference using MAFFT's --addfragments and --keeplength
flags. Output sequences preserve the reference length. Duplicate sequences are
aligned once for efficiency. Results are uppercase with names preserved.
}
\note{
Requires MAFFT to be installed and available in PATH
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Align sequences to a reference
ref <- "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY"
seqs <- c("ACDEFGH", "ACDEFGHIKL", "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQ")
aligned <- mafft_align(seqs, ref)
}
