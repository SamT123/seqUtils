\title{Read a GenBank file}
\usage{
read_genbank(path)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{Path to a GenBank (.gb) file.}
}
\value{
A list with elements: \code{id}, \code{name}, \code{description}, \code{sequence},
\code{annotations}, and \code{features}. Each feature includes a \code{parts} field: a
list of \verb{\{start, end\}} intervals (0-based, half-open). For simple features
this has length 1; for spliced features (e.g. M2, NEP) it contains one
element per exon. \code{start}/\code{end} on the feature itself remain the outer
bounds for backward compatibility.
}
\description{
Parses a GenBank file using BioPython's SeqIO, returning a structured list
with sequence, annotations, and features (including CDS).
}
\details{
Requires a Python installation with BioPython. BioPython will be installed
automatically on first use if not already available.
