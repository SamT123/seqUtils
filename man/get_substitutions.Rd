\title{Get substitutions between reference and query sequences}
\usage{
get_substitutions(
  sequence_1,
  sequence_2,
  position_map = 1:nchar(sequence_1),
  exclude = c(),
  simplify = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{sequence_1}{Reference sequence (single sequence)}

\item{sequence_2}{Query sequence(s) to compare (character vector, can be multiple). If named,
names will be preserved in the output for multi-sequence cases.}

\item{position_map}{Custom position numbering (default: 1:nchar(sequence_1)). Useful when
sequences represent a subset of positions from a larger sequence.}

\item{exclude}{Characters to ignore when comparing (e.g., "X" for unknown amino acids,
"N" for ambiguous nucleotides)}

\item{simplify}{If TRUE and only one query sequence provided, returns a character vector
instead of a list (default: TRUE)}
}
\value{
List of character vectors (one per query sequence) containing substitutions with
names from sequence_2 (if present), or a single character vector if simplify = TRUE and
only one query sequence provided. Single-sequence output is always unnamed.
}
\description{
Compares sequences and returns substitutions in the format "A123T" (reference amino acid,
position, query amino acid). Sequences are trimmed to the shortest length if they differ.
}
\examples{
# Single comparison
get_substitutions("ACDEF", "ACDEG")  # Returns "F5G"

# Multiple sequences
get_substitutions("ACDEF", c("ACDEG", "TCDEG"))

# Custom position numbering
get_substitutions("ACE", "TCE", position_map = c(145, 155, 156))

# Exclude ambiguous characters
get_substitutions("ACDEF", "XCDXF", exclude = "X")
